## **AWS Projects for Beginners**

If you‚Äôre a relative newcomer to AWS, these projects can help you explore some of the basic functionality and get familiar with best practices and more.¬†

### Getting started with AWS: IAM roles and S3

As an AWS beginner, the best way to start is to familiarize yourself with the AWS ecosystem and its services. Our [**introduction to AWS**](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-aws) course will take you through the basics and a few advanced concepts.

The two most commonly used services that any beginner should be very comfortable with are IAM and S3.

#### AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

The IAM service is included with every AWS account. Through IAM, you can add new users and control their access to AWS services and resources.

You'll need to understand how to use IAM and follow the security best practices. These skills are crucial for the AWS projects mentioned in this article.

![AWS IAM Overview](https://media.datacamp.com/cms/google/ad_4nxei_kz0dqnerc4u70jrl4paw0b3gd8d6gcvzpo3pweohrgi7kzq65wx-xbbysueytb6qqq_ldiy0a2c3gvi6nfzrzhrga22mlqbtu2zevpfizmpxlbf1_4s_guxuljsp0eoeauac-mdi9kej-9s8dalo4eo.png)

Source: [**AWS**](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/?trk=c650cd53-246f-461d-be42-6798eb775e43&sc_channel=ps)

#### AWS Simple Storage Service (S3)

AWS S3 is probably one of the most popular and most heavily used AWS services. It offers an extremely cost-effective data storage solution and is incredibly simple to set up. Amazon also offers the Elastic File System (EFS) as an alternative storage solution.¬†

Our [**AWS storage tutorial**](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/aws-s3-efs-tutorial) explores the different features and benefits of S3 and EFS.

Many of the projects listed in this article will leverage S3 as a storage solution in some way, and you will likely use it extensively in your career. Brush up on [**what Amazon S3 is**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html), and check out the chapter on [**AWS storage services**](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-aws/core-aws-services?ex=8) from our Introduction to AWS course.
